This study explores the distinct preferences and
expectations of leisure and business travelers
within the hotel industry by analyzing hotel
reviews from booking.com. Although previous
research has utilized Term Frequency-Inverse
Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to examine
various aspects of review data, it has not
adequately categorized reviews into business or
leisure categories. To address this gap, this
research employs logistic regression and Support
Vector Machine (SVM) models, leveraging TFIDF
as an analytical tool to quantitatively assess
differences in language and thematic emphasis
between these two traveler types. Both models
are used to classify the reviews, enhancing
understanding of how textual nuances correlate
with traveler categories. By identifying the
better performed model, the study will provide
actionable insights for hotels, aimed at
enhancing customer satisfaction by catering to
the diverse needs of different traveler groups and
refining service offerings to assist targeted
marketing strategies within the hospitality
industry.
